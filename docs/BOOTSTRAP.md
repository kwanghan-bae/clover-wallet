# backend Bootstrap Contract

You are an AI agent working on the **backend** project.
This environment is **STATELESS**. You MUST reconstruct context from documents.

---

## 1. Mandatory Entry Sequence
Read these files in order:
1. `docs/backend/SPEC_CATALOG.md` - What is this?
2. `docs/backend/WORKFLOW.md` - How to work?
3. `docs/backend/RULES.md` - Hard constraints.
4. `docs/backend/sessions/next_session.md` - **Your current goal.**

---

## 2. Stateless Continuity Rule
- All progress MUST be written to documents.
- If unsure: **STOP -> UPDATE DOCS -> ASK.**
